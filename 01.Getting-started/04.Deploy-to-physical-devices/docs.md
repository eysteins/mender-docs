**TODO INTRO**

## Prerequisites

**TODO**


**Congratulations!** You have used the Mender server to deploy your first managed update!
Now that you have seen how Mender works with a virtual device, you might be wondering what
it would take to port it to your own platform. The first place to go is
[Device integration](../../Devices), where you will find out how to integrate
the Mender client with your device software, and then look at
[Creating artifacts](../../Artifacts) to see how to build images ready to be
deployed over the network to your devices.
